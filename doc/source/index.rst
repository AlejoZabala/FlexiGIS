FlexiGIS: Open source GIS-based platform for the optimisation of flexibility options in urban areas
===================================================================================================
FlexiGIS is an open source GIS-based platform for modelling energy systems and flexibility
options in urban areas. FlexiGIS stands for Flexibilisation in Geographic Information
Systems (GIS). It extracts, filters and categorises the geo-referenced urban energy
infrastructure, simulates the local electricity consumption and power generation from
on-site renewable energy resources, and allocates the required decentralised storage in
urban settings. FlexiGIS investigates systematically different scenarios of self-consumption,
it analyses the characteristics and roles of flexibilisation technologies in promoting higher
autarky levels in cities. The extracted urban energy infrustructure are based mainly on `Open Street Map`_ data.
