Module III: Flexibisation optimisation
======================================
The spatial-temporal simulation outputs from Module I and II are highly resolved time series of
electricity demand and supply. Theses generated datasets will be used by the `urbs` model as
inputs to the linear optimisation problem. This module aims to determine the minimum system costs
at the given spatial urban scale while matching simultenously the simulated electricity demand.
In addition, it aims to allocate and optimise distributed storage and other felecibility options
in urban energy systems. This component will be explained in details. The codes, scripts and coupling
of urbs model and FlexiGIS platform will be added.
