# FlexiGIS

FlexiGIS is an open source GIS-based platform for the optimisation of flexibility options in urban areas.  

FlexiGIS stands for flexibilisation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It extracts, filters and clusters the geo-referenced urban energy infrastructure, simulates the local electricity consumption and power generation from on-site renewable energy resources, and allocates the required decentralised storage in urban settings. FlexiGIS investigates systematically different scenarios of self-consumption, it analyses the characteristics and roles of flexibilisation technologies in promoting higher autarky levels in cities.
